	/// This initializes all variables from either the inherited game object of PongBall specific variables.
	/// @param node This takes in a SceneNode pointer to the scene node created for the player paddle.
	/// @param scnMgr This takes in a reference to the SceneManager pointer found in the MainInitalizer class in main.cpp.
	/// @param pRef This is a PongPaddle reference that is used for collision detection between the player paddle and the ball.
	/// @note The ball is the game object that handles collision between the paddle and it's self. This is because their is no collision response for the paddle, only for the ball.
